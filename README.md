# Project: Neighborhood Map
You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places you’d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

## Installation

2. Run `npm install && bower install && gulp build --production` to build the assets
3. Setup a local server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
4. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to see the app
